    "Riga is metropolis of Baltic states (Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia). It is the largest city with population of 627 thousand and around 1 million population in its metro area. It's a vibrant and active city whose citizens are quite outgoing. There are around 8 thousand international students living in the city which adds to vibrant flavour of Riga. Interest from EU and Eastern Europe tourists has been also on the rise. \\\n",
    "Since the end of previous financial crisis around 2010-2012 Riga has experienced solid economic growth, which, given increasing presence of demographic problems, translates rather strongly to wage growth. The effects of all of this can be easily observed in the menus of local restaurants - prices have visibly inflated. Demand for dining options outside home has surged. This in turn creates wide range of opportunities for new  dining ventures. \\\n",
    "The restaurant scene is quite saturated in central neighborhoods (especially, Old City and Center) and is not clear whether there are space for new ventures. Therefore the problem is to determine if there is a market for dinning places outside the center. And what could be the best neighborhood as location for new restaurant. The potential new restaurants might have two possible focuses - either late evening dining or restaurant focused on cheaper business menu lunches to serve masses.\\\n",
    "Results of this report would be compelling for food industry entrepreneurs or possibly Riga City Municipality to see which of the neighborhoods could be developed further to increase its appeal for new restaurant related business ventures.\n"

    "In order to answer question posed in the Introduction section we firstly will determine which of neighborhoods of Riga are developed enough in terms of commercial, residential infrastructure but don't sufficient number of dining places. This will be achieved by collecting venues data in each neighborhood through Foursquare API. List of all venues in 750m radius from the center of neighborhood will retrieved.\\\n",
    "Additionally data on number of inhabitants and size of neighborhoods will be collected from Riga municipality home page. This will help to determine inhabitant density of neighborhoods which would be one of the measures of potential demand for dining places.\\\n",
    "Specifically to measure demand for eating places offering business menus, data on number of people employed in each neighborhood will be downloaded from Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia.\\\n",
    "Lastly, as a measure of purchasing power data on valued added (calculated as sum of profit and wages paid by the companies in neighborhoods) will be used. This data also will be downloaded from Central Statistical Bureau of Latvia. Consequently, value added per capita will be calculated. Clearly, average or median wage in each neighborhood would be more appropriate data in this case, however, it is not available."
